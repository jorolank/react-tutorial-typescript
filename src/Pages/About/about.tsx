            Tic-tac-toe is a game in which two players take turns in drawing either an ' O' or an ' X' in one square of
            a grid consisting of nine squares. The winner is the first player to get three of the same symbols in a row.
            Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns
            marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their
            marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
